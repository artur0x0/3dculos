# Agent export

SurfCAD helpers stay in this repo. The external agent package pins a 3dculos commit and copies the files in `src/lib/surfcad/catalog/sync-files.json`. It does not keep a second copy of the helper source.

This package is `"private": true`. Do not publish it as npm `surfcad`. That name belongs to the helper library the agent repo publishes.

## Public surface

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/surfcad/index.js` | Node entry. `loadManifold`, `runScript`, `helperScope`, `HELPER_FUNCTIONS`, `exportResult`, `meshToStl`, `meshTo3mfBytes`, `meshToStepBytes`, `sheetSpecToStep`. |
| `src/lib/surfcad/runtime.js` | Helper implementations, `executeScript`, and `bindWorker`. |
| `src/lib/surfcad/export.js` | STL, 3MF, and STEP from a `runScript` result. |
| `src/workers/sandboxWorker.js` | Browser worker. It only calls `bindWorker`. |
| `src/lib/surfcad/catalog/*.json` | Generated catalogs (below). |

`helperScope(mod)` returns the Manifold API plus `HELPER_FUNCTIONS`. `runScript` also injects the limited `window` import bag and the feature-trace hooks, the same way `executeScript` does.

## Kernel

The headless entry and the worker both need the shipped custom build: `built/manifold.js` and `built/manifold.wasm`. npm `manifold-3d` is a different build. On that package `status()` is the string `'NoError'`; on this build it is an enum object. Goldens and the app use the custom build.

`built/manifold.js` loads the wasm next to itself (`import.meta.url`) under Node. `runScript` / `loadManifold` also accept:

- `manifold` or `module` — an already constructed module
- `modulePath` plus optional `wasmPath` or `locateFile` — another copy of this factory

## Script evaluation

`runScript` calls `executeScript`. The script body is `"use strict";\n` plus the source, passed to `new Function(...helperNames, script)`. A top-level `let` or `const` in the user script shadows a helper of the same name. Do not wrap the script in another function.

`runScript` does not call worker global lockdown. That lockdown replaces `fetch` and other names on the worker global and would freeze the host process. Geometry and the helper scope match the worker.

Helpers close over one module per process, the one bound by `initializeManifold` or `bindManifoldModule`.

`runScript` returns `{ manifold, mesh, volume, surfaceArea, status, tris, boundingBox, bodyCentroids, bodyCount, parts }`. `status` is `'NoError'` when the solid is valid. `parts` is `{ index, at }` per body centroid.

## Exports

`exportResult(result, 'stl' | '3mf' | 'step')` returns bytes (`Uint8Array`).

- STL is binary.
- 3MF is the app's uncompressed OPC zip (`export3MF`).
- STEP is `meshToStep` (coplanar faces merged, curves stay faceted) unless `sheetSpec` is passed, in which case `buildSheetExport` writes true-curve cylinders (`brepToStep`) when the spec folds.

`sheetSpecToStep(spec, { mesh, script, name })` returns `{ bytes, text, stepSource, blocked, dfm, brepError }`. `stepSource: 'spec'` is the true-curve path.

## Catalog

`npm run export:agent` (`scripts/export-agent-catalog.mjs`) rewrites `src/lib/surfcad/catalog/`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `helpers.json` | Every `HELPER_FUNCTIONS` key: name, signature, params (with defaults), description, doc, examples. Sources are JSDoc, `HELPER_FUNCTIONS.md`, and a small gap list in the generator. |
| `manifold.json` | Static constructors and instance methods of `Manifold` and `CrossSection`, plus the module functions, from `built/manifold-encapsulated-types.d.ts`. |
| `assembly.schema.json` | `.surf.json` JSON Schema: `format` `surfcad.assembly`, `version` 1, part `{ id, path, name, visible, order, position, sheetMetal, copiedFrom }`, optional `groups: [{ id, name, source, partIds }]`, the `// @surf-id` header, and the `local-` id prefix. |
| `sheet-metal.json` | `part.sheetMetal` (`sku` required), the `// --- sheet-metal begin/end ---` block, `sheetMetalSolid`, DFM rules, and export options. |
| `sync-files.json` | The copy list for an external consumer, plus `regenerate`. |

Regenerate in this repo when a helper is added or its signature or docs change, and when the shipped Manifold `.d.ts` changes. Copy the JSON. Do not regenerate from a partial tree.

`npm run golden:agent-catalog` fails if a `HELPER_FUNCTIONS` key has no catalog entry, or an entry has no signature and one-line description.

## Sync

Pin a 3dculos commit. Copy every path in `sync-files.json` `runtimeFiles` and `catalogFiles`, keeping those paths. The imports are static ESM relative to those paths, and the wasm sits next to `built/manifold.js`.

That is a sparse copy of the import graph of `src/lib/surfcad/index.js`, not a fork and not an npm subpath of this private package.

## What stays stable

- The keys of `HELPER_FUNCTIONS` (a new key needs a catalog regen; the catalog golden fails until then).
- The `runScript` return shape above.
- The catalog file names.
- `bindWorker` message types the app already sends (`init`, `execute`, `ping`, `previewCut`, `previewBoolean`, `previewBlock`, and the rest of that handler).
