# Slice 01 golden cases (in-repo)

Authoritative geometry regression lives in **cadgen-workspace** (`npm run verify`).
These files are the in-repo puzzle vocabulary smoke + copy-paste scripts for
review while the private harness may be unavailable.

| File | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `smoke_slice01.mjs` | Fastener diameter tables + clearance/tap/cbore/csk/fillet/chamfer loud-fail via `manifold-3d` (npm) |
| `puzzle_clearance_plate.js` | Copy-paste SurfCAD script: plate + M3 clearance + M4 cbore + chamfer |
| `puzzle_fillet_box.js` | Copy-paste SurfCAD script: filleted box (convexEdges) |

Run smoke (no cadgen-workspace required):

```bash
node scripts/golden/smoke_slice01.mjs
```

Note: npm `manifold-3d` ≠ bundled `built/manifold.wasm`. Gate acceptance still
requires `test_real_worker.mjs` via `npm run verify` once the harness is present.

| `smoke_slice21_cross_section.mjs` | Slice 21 cross-section substrate: plane from planar face, profiles, preview, compose |
| `smoke_slice23_fillet_via_sweep.mjs` | Slice 23 sweep fillet: wedge contours, palette Strategy=sweep, closed-rim + post-fillet geometry via worker |
| `smoke_slice24_contour_mode.mjs` | Slice 24 contour-mode shell: plane refuse, Profile-in-mode compose (no Extrude), update-in-place, #30 fillet sweep default |
| `smoke_slice25_extrude.mjs` | Slice 25 Extrude solid: live preview params, Confirm compose (makeExtrude + placeInFrame replace), update-in-place, Back/no-orphan, #30 fillet sweep default |
| `smoke_slice26_revolve.mjs` | Slice 26 Revolve solid: identity (u,v)→(radial,height) remap (centered circle → sphere; washer → torus), live preview params, Confirm compose (makeRevolve + placeInFrame replace), update-in-place, Back/no-orphan, Extrude/Profile/Loft unchanged, #30 fillet sweep default |
| `smoke_slice28_loft.mjs` | Slice 28 Loft multi-profile: same workplane + offsets, live preview, Confirm compose (makeCrossSection × N + makeLoft + placeInFrame replace), update-in-place, Back/no-orphan, Extrude/Revolve/Fillet unchanged |
| `smoke_hotfix_frame_only_plane_undo_autorun.mjs` | Hotfix: empty Confirm is frame-only (no host cube / no part.add); existing part unions; Undo/Redo Auto-Run via setTextOnly + handleGameRun |
| `smoke_hotfix_contour_picker_additive.mjs` | Hotfix: saved contours list + ghosts, auto-pick last, Profile/Workplane in Advanced, additive Confirm keeps cube volume |
| `smoke_polish_adv_ux.mjs` | Polish: loft circle↔rect sharp corners + view-aligned default, Confirm exits contour mode, Sweep path selector inside the popup, Workplane is a plane (no host cube), blank/plane-only script clears the viewport |
| `smoke_slice27_fillet_mode.mjs` | Slice 27 Fillet-in-mode: enter without edges, live blend preview as edges accumulate, Accept compose (makeSweepPath + filletAlongPath) + replace-in-place, Back/no-commit, disjoint edges → independent fillets (2+ components), #27–#30 sweep stack |
| `smoke_fillet_followup.mjs` | Fillet follow-up: loft overlay stays bounded, blend strips are not candidates, sequential sharp-edge Accept appends, blend-only Accept fails loud |
| `smoke_fillet_easy_hard.mjs` | Slice B: box / extrude edges easy (no warn reason); circle↔square loft generator hard with a stable reason; Accept stays allowed; huge radius and long chains warn |
| `smoke_fillet_box_corners.mjs` | Four vertical corners of a plain box: picker Accept and a script fillet both run, and fail if `no boundary between faces` would toast |
| `smoke_edge_contour_identity.mjs` | Edge and contour graphs: same chains, edge counts, and contour counts on Artur's mesh and on the pre-#154 dense mesh |
| `smoke_fillet_kernel_spike_c.mjs` | Slice C/C2: hard kernel recommendation + production flag; hard Accept emits filletEdges+relaxPlanar; pick-mode restore + selector gap |
| `smoke_fillet_c2_rolling_ball.mjs` | Slice C2/C3: hard loft Accept path + scrap guard; C3 supersedes rolling-ball with variableProfile; known-scrap relaxPlanar loud-fails /sliver scraps/ |
| `smoke_fillet_c3_variable_sweep.mjs` | Slice C3: tangency field G1 vs zig-zag; loft Tangent-on human-scale; hard Accept → variableProfile sweep; R≈1.6 no zero-area banner delta; easy cube clean |
| `smoke_fillet_c3_1_along_path_tangency.mjs` | Slice C3.1: along-path frame transport; gut transport → staircase RED; hard loft WASM transport meta + C3 volume pin |
| `smoke_fillet_c3_2_tighter_continuity.mjs` | Slice C3.2: single-run variableProfile cutter + denser/curvature densify + tighter damp; loft-like θ-run staircase pin; hard loft WASM runCount=1 |
| `smoke_fillet_c3_3_varying_profile.mjs` | Slice C3.3: per-knot varying cross-section for hard variableProfile; **distribution net** — removed volume per quarter must follow the dihedral ramp (total-only guards cannot tell a median-θ gouge from a correct blend) |
| `smoke_fillet_c4_signed_concave.mjs` | Slice C4: signed local convexity (no per-edge CSG ball probe), per-knot sign, concave = material-ADD filler; mixed-sign chain splits into cutter + filler runs; zero face-group normal fallback |
| `smoke_cad_palette_overlays.mjs` | CAD Model section promotes Profile/Workplane/Extrude/Revolve/Sweep/Loft (game Advanced rail unchanged); Plane/Contour toggles default on and gate overlay paint and picking |
| `smoke_cad_mobile_chrome.mjs` | CAD phone shell matches puzzle: viewport top, Monaco bottom budget, keyboard pin, mid-strip actions, vertical right rail |

| `smoke_fillet_chamfer_rounded_wrap.mjs` | Fillet-on-fillet rounded-rect wrap + path chamfer quality |
| `smoke_block_pose_preview.mjs` | Block pop: position and rotation on all six solids, preview mesh matches the script, identity pose is omitted, Subtract preview is the cutter and does not replace the cached solid; Add and Subtract paint with the previewStyle cyan skin + crease outline (Loft's look), never the CAD normal material |
| `smoke_cross_part_clone.mjs` | Edit-touch C: cross-part Boolean (union / difference / intersect with piece delete) and Subtract Block copies via `externalBody`, frozen and posed into the target frame; yellow external chip; copy deleted with the feature; one undo step per written part |
| `smoke_fillet_three_corner_wrap.mjs` | Three-fillet corner wrap (r=3.73 variable-profile chain through three r=2 fillets): true ~90° per-knot θ, one genus-0 body, volume window, no nested shell inside, every picked edge rounded, flat walls solid |
| `smoke_multi_part_easy_fillet.mjs` | Multi-part easy fillet: each part of a multi-part Fillet Accept matches its solo Fillet (untouched seed 2 mm, a 4 mm plate clamps to 1.8, radius + class from its own solid unless typed; volume, area, tris, genus), both active directions, plate + rim, typed radius |
| `smoke_part_overlays_stick.mjs` | Contours and work planes stick to their part: per-part sources (editor = live buffer, hidden skipped), per-part anchors (pick mesh / own solid / row), A's plane + contour stay on A across a switch and follow A's move; editor-only picks |
| `smoke_feature_failed_chip.mjs` | Failed feature → red strip chip border: worker `scriptLine` of the failing call, mapped to that marked block only; no frame / outside a block marks nothing; edit clears; red-400 wins over yellow; successful tones unchanged |
| `smoke_failed_part_outline.mjs` | Failing part in the viewer: red-400 outline + tint + glow rim on its last good solid, no raycast, rebuilt / disposed with geometry; same failed ids as the Parts feed; App → viewport wiring |
| `smoke_fillet_default_radius.mjs` | Fillet default radius: fixed 2 mm as edges accumulate on one part and across parts (not 0.1 × path length), thin part clamps (0.45 × thinnest extent), typed radius shared; seed / Accept wiring |
| `smoke_part_rename_target.mjs` | Two-part rename: title rename lands on the part the title shows (viewer pick, not activeId), feed row renames its own id, stale/blank/unknown no-ops; App / title chip / feed row wiring |
| `smoke_fillet_chamfer_multi_rotation.mjs` | FilletKiller chain that turns 360° through four R=2 arcs (fixtures `artur_playtest_chamfer_multi_rotation.txt`, `artur_playtest_fillet_three_corner_wrap.txt`): chamfer r=2 has no lip/step on the y=−10 top leg (ball probes, −x and vertical-leg controls); fillet r=3.73 has θ 88°..92°, no inverted top facets, volume window; sliver-safe ray / planar normal / tight-arc split wiring |
