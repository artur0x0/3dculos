 * (`max-h` only): the rail is only as tall as its buttons need, and yields the
 * rest of the viewport. When the window is too short, the rail scrolls.
 *
 * **Height and scrolling are separate on purpose.** They used to be one class,
 * which made the RIGHT rail a scroll container too — and that broke two things
 * at once: it grew a scrollbar it never needed, and, because the view-snap
 * flyout is positioned OUTSIDE the rail box (`absolute right-full`), the
 * overflow clipped the flyout away entirely. Only rails that actually overflow
 * (the left tool palettes) may take RAIL_SCROLL_CLASS; the right rail stays
 * `overflow-visible` so the flyout can escape.
